                        I am an inviting eatery with a laid-back atmosphere and enticing Italian cuisine. I am an outpost of Montreal’s much-loved Pizzeria Moretti, bringing such signature dishes to Toronto as antipasti, pizza and pasta, and gourmet desserts like our famous Nutella-and-strawberry pizza and homemade ice creams. I am located in the heart of Home Société with a second entrance that opens onto Cartwright Street. I am fresh, unexpected, authentically Italian and scheduled to open in the late spring.
